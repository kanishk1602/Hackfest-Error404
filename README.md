Problem statement: 
Many daily wage workers are unable to find suitable work at labour chowks. 

For work seekers, unavailability of reliable job information in the areas where work may be available. They also need to determine whether the work available matches their skill.

Daily wage work is still an offline process. Also a bit time consuming. A world were food delivery and items of basic necessities is delivered within minutes, a web portal for daily wage workers to get connected with employers is need of the hour. 

We have an ambitious idea to integrate the daily wage and labour class sector to the tech-driven society. Simple statistics of demand distribution can help needs met. Until now, there has been no reliable method to figure out which location can serve best to a job provider and job seekers interest. If a person can get work requests online, along with an idea of density of demand in different areas it can increase the probability of grabbing a job which also matches their expertise skill. This approach also provides flexibility and convenience. An online portal to bring hirers and labourers together will be our objective on which weâ€™ll be working upon for the next 36 hours.
